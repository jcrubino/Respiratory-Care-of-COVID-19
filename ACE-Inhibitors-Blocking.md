# Angeotensin System Blockers and Inhibitors

*This is not medical advice.  No standard treatment or medication guidance has been given for COVID-19 patients.*

The role of the Angeotensin Converting Enzyme 2 has been shown to be the primary cell path in which the COVID-19 virus enters host cells.
Because of the importance of ACE Inhibitors and Blockers in the modern medicine formulary, this section is a list of links to current opinions and data
regarding the treatment of patients already using ACE inhibitors and blockers.

- Renin–Angiotensin–Aldosterone System Inhibitors in Patients with Covid-19
  - Highlights: Evidence ACEi and ARB's will improve outcomes in hypertensive patients, upregulation of ACE2 *might* be helpful to covid patients where the enzyme is downregulated via viral occupation.   Insufficient human data to make conclusions against use of ACEi and ARBs.

- ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers may increase the risk of severe COVID-19, paper suggests
  - Source: Science Daily
  - Highlights: Angiotensin Inhibitors and Blockers have been shown to increase ACE-2 sites in exeprimental models.  It is theorized this creates a larger or continued attack surface area for the virus. This may explain an increased morbidity in patients using Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers.

- SARS-CoV2: should inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin system be withdrawn in patients with COVID-19?
  - Source: European Heart Journal
  - Highlight: Withdrawal of RAAS inhibition or preemptive switch to alternate drugs at this point seems not advisable, since it might even increase cardiovascular mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients.
