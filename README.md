### Scuttlebut Points of Practice
  - Know the false positive rate of the available COVID-19 test **and the false negative**.
  - Know the Time for Viral Infection Replication to lead to a Postive Test.

### NIV Helmet Ventilation

*NIV Helmet Ventilation has been cited as early as 2016 for reducing ARDS intubations. Being an Italian medical (re)Invention is very likely why Italian hostpital footage shows these type of NIV systems on patients in the wards.*

### Treatment Pharmocology

There is no known cure nor standard drug choice for Corona Virus.  Treatment is supportive care.  Evaluation of all pharmacology related treatments still requires well executed clinical trials at this time.  That said here is some pesentations and research being published on Pharmacological routes to suppress or shorten the course of the viral infection.
